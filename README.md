# p2p-lending-platform
This project is a decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending Platform built using Solidity, Ethereum, MetaMask, and Ganache. It demonstrates how blockchain technology can remove the need for traditional intermediaries by allowing borrowers and lenders to interact directly through smart contracts.

In this system, borrowers can create loan requests by specifying the amount and interest they are willing to pay. Lenders can browse available loan requests and fund any loan they choose. Once funded, the smart contract automatically transfers the loan amount to the borrower. Borrowers then repay the loan (including interest), and lenders can withdraw their returns securely.

The project uses:

Solidity for writing secure smart contracts

Remix IDE for compiling and deploying the contract

Ganache as a local blockchain network for testing

MetaMask as the Web3 wallet for interacting with the smart contract

HTML + JavaScript (Web3.js) for a simple DApp frontend

This project aims to demonstrate how decentralized lending works on a blockchain and can serve as a learning foundation for building more advanced DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications such as collateralized loans, token-based lending, automated interest rates, or credit score–based lending.
